Hi Team,
 
Please circulate this with everyone.
 
Assignment for today. Please acknowledge me once you receive the mail:
 
Example1:
 
Create a single cast delegate CalculateSimpleInterest and use the reference of the getTotalInterest method.
GetTotalInterest will do the simple interest calculation based on Principal, Rate and year properties.
Extend this single cast delegate into Multi cast delegate by referencing more method getInterestRatePerYear.
 
Try creating delegates using below:
Using Func and Action.
Using Anonymous methods.
Using lambda expressions.
 
Example2:
 
Implement the Events by referring this link https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11541/The-Simplest-C-Events-Example-Imaginable.
Even though the code is mentioned in the link please first understand the code and then try to implement by your own. Itâ€™s very easy example.
 
Example3:
 
Create a class Employee with following properties { ID, Name, DepartmentName, ProjectName}
Create a Employee Collection using List<Employee>.
Perform different Lambda operation using Where, Select, Any, Group by, Find and many more.
Find below the list of lambda operation for more understanding.
